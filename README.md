This data was collected to determine the impact that experimental warming and reduced rainfall has on decomposing fungal necromass in a temperate-boreal ecotone. We incubated fungal necromass and determined mass loss across time (1, 2, 7, and 14 weeks), sequenced the associated bacterial and fungal communities, and assessed microbial substrate utilization using biolog eco plates.
